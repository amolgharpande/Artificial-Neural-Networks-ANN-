We are looking into a data set of bank, having 1000 customers (1000 rows). Bank experienced that the customers are leaving unexpectedly at higher rate. To analyse what happened and why customers are leaving bank, they hire you to give some insights from available data to resolve/overcome the problem. Bank provided dummy and small amount of data for testing purpose.
We solved above case study using deep learning.Deep Learning is the most exciting and powerful branch of Machine Learning. Deep Learning models can be used for a variety of complex tasks:
We used Artificial-Neural-Networks algorithm.
